## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 




*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 

    
*List at least 10 product features*


AirBnb
https://www.airbnb.com/

Relevance to Marriott Stays: 
    AirBnb is one of the well known booking vacation stays apps, so they are big competition for Marriott‚Äôs Home & Villas. These features can provide the hotel customer service experience online by providing resources to nearby food, entertainment and attractions. They can still get the benefit of staying at a hotel with resources for activities all on their app. 

Product Features: 
1. The navigation bar is tailored only to homes and experiences with a search bar that filters the vacation stays by categories, price and more specificities. 

2. Profile and account information in the right hand corner with hamburger menu to collapse the dropdown.

3. 2 column grid with card carousels to show location of stay, pricing and pictures. 

4. Badges added to cards to label them as ‚Äúguest favorites‚Äù - pull people in that the pictures and post is legit since others find it a good stay.

5. There‚Äôs a filter menu that is easy to navigate and pick specific requirements the user will like for their stay. (more descriptive than other sites)

6. ‚ÄúDisplay total before tax‚Äù is a good thing for users because it shows the full price of the rental with tax. Good for user‚Äôs budget planning and avoid any hidden fees or security deposit at checkout. 

7. Show on map button at the bottom that allows the user to view the location of units on a google map. 

8. Users might like the visual of where the stay will be in proximity to the city. 

9. The explore feature is a great tool. After booking a stay, there is an option to explore activities and events around the area that is posted on the AirBnb app. This allows the user to continue using the app after checkout/booking. 

10. Communication chat available once the booking has been confirmed. The chat gives users the ability to talk with the host directly to communicate any questions about the house rules/check-in process or accommodations. 


Vrbo
https://www.vrbo.com/

Relevance to Marriott Stays: 
    I see the Marriott benefiting from their ability to access vacation homes like AirBnb, as well as seeing hotel deals for users who prefer to lodge in a commercial setting. 

Product Features: 
1. Pop up menu with ‚Äúmembers get more deals when signed in‚Äù pushes the user to make an account. 

2. Navigation shows trip planning, downloading the app, and signing into account. 

3. Main search bar is centered on the hero image that filters listings from location, date and amount of travelers. 

4. A sliding carousel to show popular bookings and vacation spots - easy for users to browse what catches their attention and interests. 

5. A use of multiple carousels to show ‚Äústyle of listing‚Äù, ‚Äúweekend getaways‚Äù, etc

6. Once a user clicks on the navigation items, there is a window that expects users to create an account. 

7. The main search bar listings button loads a page of stays with cards that showcase pricing, rating/reviews, prices (per night, in total) and description and pictures of the listing. 

8. Heart button in top right corner of listing photo

9. Listing Location in miles (km) from search ‚Äúcity‚Äù above heading in the card listing
    Also has a view in map button that sticks to the bottom center of the page

10. Push to download their app by having download buttons on their site


HomeToGo
https://www.hometogo.com/


Relevance to Marriott Stays: 
    HomeToGo has more home focused listing options than Vrbo and AirBnb. They are more tailored to users who want to stay at a home rather than traditional hotel lodging. This is similar to the Marriott‚Äôs Homes and Villas mission to make staying on vacation a home away from home.

Product Features: 
1. Users can search by all 50 states and worldwide destinations in a carousel card widget at the bottom of the homepage. Would help with users wanting to find somewhere but don‚Äôt know exactly where to start. 

2. Navigation is more robust than Vrbo and Airbnb with a hamburger menu for both desktop and mobile. The collapse menu provides options of signing in, wishlists and help center. Style and transition to collapse is very smooth and sleek. 

3. Hero image with search bar centered, good for user experience to know where to start searching. This was shared across all the companies. 

4. Heart shaped button on the right hand corner for listing cards to save homes and add to wishlist 

5. Star rating on the listing card that is clickable to view reviews 

6. Button all match with the same gradient from the main hero image to the card listing buttons

7. Option in the navigation to change languages, currency and measurement system. Plus for usability and accessibility for users. 

8. Help center button in navigation loads to another page where you can search specific support. There is a chat with an expert pop up menu to ask any questions live to an advisor. 

9. Carousels of categories inside of the card images that have the hover effect

10. Map of listing on the main listing page, no button stuck to the home screen.

I think the Marriott should infuse the way Vrbo and AirBnb make their website more accessible with ‚Äúshow on map‚Äù buttons stuck on the search page, saving listings and being able to open the access to user‚Äôs friends and family, and making clear pricing expectations for listings on the display card.

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The first user qualitative research suggests that users do not have a specific idea or destination in mind, so there should be options available to help break down the decision. However, in the user research we surveyed (quantitative), the highest percentage of users know what type of vacation they are wanting to book, but they have not settled on a destination. 


There are some connections between the quantitative and qualitative data that was gathered from users. From both methods of research, most users are not exactly sure where and what type of destination they are looking for while browsing the site. They are hoping to be led in the right direction to fit their interests, so implementing more customizable options when searching will help users narrow down their search. 


In our user interviews, both are interested in going somewhere new, but they are unsure where to start.


Pain Points: 
1. Destination map page way to clutter, hard to search through listings if location is not decided. 
2. Images and headings on the main webpage have users second-guessing if there are luxurious listings for a smaller group of people, most advertisements and categories are tailored to bigger groups. 


User wishlists: 
1. One user from the research mentioned that the home isn‚Äôt the only thing that he is searching for amenities and activities in the area to do at each property.  
2. One user indicated that she wishes there were filter options on the destination map, or a drop down menu on the navigation bar, where you can choose certain themes or specific destinations ideas instead of having to sift through the clutter lists.
